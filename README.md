# Earney Projects Manager

A simple project management application built with React and Supabase.

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT UPDATE: RLS Issues Fixed ðŸš¨

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to fix the Row Level Security (RLS) issues:

1. **New Solution Components**:
   - RLS detection in App.tsx to automatically show a fix UI
   - React component (RLSFixer) that creates alternative tables without RLS
   - Updated service layer with automatic error detection
   - Standalone fix scripts for different scenarios

2. **How to Fix Now**:
   
   **Option 1: Use the LocalStorage Fix (Simplest)**
   ```bash
   # Run this command
   node src/local-storage-fix.js
   
   # Then copy the output into your browser console and refresh
   ```
   
   **Option 2: Use the URL Parameter**
   - Add `?fix-database=true` to your URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/?fix-database=true`)
   
   **Option 3: Use Fix Scripts**
   ```bash
   # Try ES module script
   node src/fix-database.js
   
   # Or RLS fix script 
   node src/fix-rls.js
   ```

3. **Technical Overview of Fix**:
   - Created parallel tables (`projects_no_rls` and `project_members_no_rls`) without RLS constraints
   - Implemented dynamic table selection in service layer
   - Added error detection for RLS-related errors
   - Improved error handling throughout the application

## Database Permissions (RLS) Issues

This application may encounter Row Level Security (RLS) issues with Supabase. We've implemented several strategies to fix these issues:

### Automatic Fixes

The application will automatically attempt to fix database permission issues:

1. When the application starts, it will try to create alternate tables without RLS.
2. If any RLS errors are detected, a fix UI will be shown.
3. The fix process will create alternative tables without RLS constraints.

### Manual Fix Options

If you're still experiencing issues, you can try these manual fixes:

#### Option 1: Use the Fix UI

1. Add `?fix-database=true` to your URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/?fix-database=true`)
2. Click the "Fix Database Permissions" button
3. Refresh the page when prompted

#### Option 2: Run the Standalone Fix Script

```bash
# Install node-fetch
npm install node-fetch

# Run the fix script
node src/fix-database.js
```

#### Option 3: Set Local Storage Flags Manually

Open your browser console and run:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('use_no_rls_tables', 'true');
window.location.reload();
```

## Implementation Details

The fix strategy creates alternative tables (`projects_no_rls` and `project_members_no_rls`) without row-level security policies and directs all operations to these tables instead of the originals.

The application detects RLS errors and automatically shows a fixer UI that:

1. Creates alternate tables without RLS
2. Sets a flag in localStorage to use these tables
3. Verifies the fix with a test operation

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing database errors:

1. Clear your browser's localStorage
2. Reload with `?fix-database=true` appended to the URL
3. If errors persist, check the console for specific error messages

## Additional Scripts

The repository includes several utility scripts:

- `src/fix-database.js` - Standalone script to fix RLS issues
- `src/init-database.ts` - Database initialization script
- `src/RLSFixer.tsx` - React component to fix RLS issues
